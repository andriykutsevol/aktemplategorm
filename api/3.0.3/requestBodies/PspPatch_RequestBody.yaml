# example with null:
# {
#   "PspCode": null,
#   "SomeTestInteger": null,
#   "DeletedAt": null,
#   "DeletedBy": null
# }

# It will produce:
# key:  PspCode value:  <nil>
# key:  SomeTestInteger value:  <nil>
# key:  DeletedAt value:  <nil>
# key:  DeletedBy value:  <nil>
# on backend.
# If we'll ommit some field, it will just not be there on backend.
# So, If it's <nil> we know that we have to set it to nil in the database also.
